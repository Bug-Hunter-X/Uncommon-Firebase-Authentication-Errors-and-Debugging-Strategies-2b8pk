The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an error if the user's email address is invalid or already in use, but the error messages aren't always very descriptive, leading to confusion in debugging. For example, a generic "Network request failed" might mask the underlying authentication issue.  Another problem arises when dealing with asynchronous operations and error handling.  If you don't properly handle promises or async/await, errors might be silently swallowed, making debugging very difficult.  Finally, a common mistake is failing to check the `user` object after a successful authentication operation.  If the authentication process unexpectedly returns null or undefined for the user object, your app could have subtle and hard-to-debug issues.
