To improve the clarity of error messages, always check the specific error codes provided by Firebase's authentication methods. Use try...catch blocks to handle errors and log detailed error information, including the error code and message. This will greatly aid in identifying the root cause. When working with asynchronous functions such as `createUserWithEmailAndPassword`, always use promises or async/await to properly handle the results and potential errors.  Never assume the authentication process will always succeed without explicit checks and proper error handling.  After authentication, always validate that the `user` object returned is not null or undefined before proceeding with user-specific actions. This helps prevent silent failures and subsequent unexpected application behavior. Consider implementing a centralized error-handling mechanism to consistently manage and log authentication-related errors across your application. A well-structured logging system is critical for effective debugging and monitoring.
