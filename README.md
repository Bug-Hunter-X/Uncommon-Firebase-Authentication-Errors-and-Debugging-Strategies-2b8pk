This repository demonstrates uncommon errors encountered when using Firebase Authentication in JavaScript projects.  The included code examples showcase scenarios where error messages are unclear, asynchronous operations are mishandled, and crucial checks for the user object after authentication are omitted. Solutions are provided to address these issues and improve debugging workflows.  This is particularly helpful for developers encountering unexpected authentication behaviors, such as a missing user object after a seemingly successful login attempt.
